# hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.

# Print out the columns Origin up to Cancelled of hflights

   # starts_with("X"): every name that starts with "X",

   # contains("X"): every name that contains "X",
   # matches("X"): every name that matches "X", where "X" can be a regular expression,
   # num_range("x", 1:5): the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04 and x05,
   # one_of(x): every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.
   
# As usual, hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.

# Print out a tbl containing just ArrDelay and DepDelay
select(hflights, ends_with("Delay"))

# Print out a tbl as described in the second instruction, using both helper functions and variable names
select(hflights, UniqueCarrier, ends_with("Num"), starts_with("Cancel"))

# Print out tbl as described in the third instruction, using only helper functions.
select(hflights, contains("Tim"), contains("Del"))


# comparison to base R

# both hflights and dplyr are available

# Finish select call so that ex1d matches ex1r
