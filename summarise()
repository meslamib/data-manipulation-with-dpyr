   # mean(x) - mean value of vector x.
   # median(x) - median value of vector x.
   # quantile(x, p) - pth quantile of vector x.
   # sd(x) - standard deviation of vector x.
   # var(x) - variance of vector x.
   # IQR(x) - Inter Quartile Range (IQR) of vector x.
   # diff(range(x)) - total range of vector x.
   # first(x) - The first element of vector x.
   # last(x) - The last element of vector x.
   # nth(x, n) - The nth element of vector x.
   # n() - The number of rows in the data.frame or group of observations that summarise() describes.
   # n_distinct(x) - The number of unique values in vector x
